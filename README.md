Portfolio of my current and finished projects in Data Science and Analytics

# Data Mining

## [Project 1: Customer Segmentation:](https://github.com/roelrrr/Datamining---Wonderful-World-Of-Wines-Marketing-Strategies-)
* Performed two segmentations based upon value & engagement and buying behavior of customers
* Goal: Establish data-driven marketing strategies for the company Wonderful World of Wines (WWW)
* Dataset consisted of 10.000 records with 18 features, delivered by WWW
* Relative clean dataset, focus on the use of datamining techniques and providing marketing strategies
* Combined Hierarchical Clustering with Kmeans Clustering to reach to valuable outcomes
* Including a full written [report](https://github.com/roelrrr/Datamining---Wonderful-World-Of-Wines-Marketing-Strategies-/blob/main/Content/B01-WonderfulWinesoftheWorld.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/roelrrr/Datamining---Wonderful-World-Of-Wines-Marketing-Strategies-/blob/main/Content/Final_Presentation.pptx) with findings.

# Machine Learning

## [Project 2: Predict Hotel Booking Cancellations](https://github.com/roelrrr/Predicting_Cancellations)
* Project is still work in progress
* Completition: 22nd of March
* For the Project description click on the [link](https://github.com/roelrrr/Predicting_Cancellations#readme)

## [Project 1: Predicting Online Buying Behavior](https://github.com/roelrrr/Predicting_Online_Buying_Behavior)
* Build a predictive model that answer the question "Which customers are more likely to buy our products?"
* Use PCA to reduce dimensionality 
* Evaluation criteria: F1 score
* Testing the following ML models: Linear & Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Instance based KNN-Classifier, Decision Tree, Neural Networks, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest, Bagging Classifier, Stacking Classifier
* All our notebooks for the different modeling can be found [here](https://github.com/roelrrr/Predicting_Online_Buying_Behavior/tree/main/Scripts)
* Based upon F1 scores we checked which method had the best outcome
* We developed a model that was good for a 9th place of 56 groups in the [(Kaggle competition)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/techscape-ecommerce/leaderboard?tab=public)
* A full report about our modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/roelrrr/Predicting_Online_Buying_Behavior/blob/main/Description/Guidelines_Group_Project_Master_202122.pdf)



# MySQL DataBase 

## [Project 1: DBMS: Portuguese Restaurant Chain](https://github.com/roelrrr/DatabaseSystem-For-A-Burger-Restaurant-Chain) 
* Created a DBMS for a Burger Restaurant Chain to optimize workflow of orders
* Built Triggers for updating a log table with incoming orders 
* Built Views for creating receipt
* Using SQL to understand revenue performances of the different restaurants --> [Code](https://github.com/roelrrr/DatabaseSystem-For-A-Burger-Restaurant-Chain/tree/main/Scripts)
* [Project Description](https://github.com/roelrrr/DatabaseSystem-For-A-Burger-Restaurant-Chain/blob/main/Description/description.pdf)
* Built an ERD-Diagram
